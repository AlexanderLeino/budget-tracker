Gives the user the ablility to access a ledger that can track deposits and withdrawls while on or offline. The user can use the ledger offline because the program uses indexdb to store in data that is submited when the user isnt currently connected too the internet. Once the user is connected to the internet then the indexdb will sync to the mongodb and save the differences between the two. Then once that has occured then it will show a graph of the deposits and withdraws.
